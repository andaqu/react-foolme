### RULES

1. There are two teams: Humans and Impostors. There is also a player controlled by an AI.
2. Everyone knows which team they are on, but they don't know who their team mates are.
3. The Humans are trying to figure out who the AI player is, while the Impostors are trying to fool the Humans into thinking one of them is the AI player.
4. Everyone in the game gets to ask one question, and everyone gets to answer it (including the person who asked the question). No one knows who asked the question. The AI player doesn't get to ask a question.
5. After all the answers are in, players on the Humans team get to vote for who they think is the AI player based on the answers.
6. All votes are anonymous.

### GAMEPLAY

**Asking stage:** Someone asks a question.

```
Question: Why is the sky blue? (posed by Human 1, but no one knows this)

Human 1:
Human 2:
Human 3:
Impostor 1:
Impostor 2:
AI:
```

**Answering stage:** Everyone answers the question.

```
Human 1: Gases and stuff!
Human 2: Because the sky is blue.
Human 3: I don't know.
Impostor 1: I'm a human, don't vote for me!
Impostor 2: It's because of the atmosphere.
AI: The sky is blue because of the atmosphere.
```

**Voting stage:** Everyone gets one vote for who they think is the AI.

```
*Humans vote*

Human 1: +0
Human 2: +1
Human 3: +0
Impostor 1: +0
Impostor 2: +2
AI: +0
```

In this case, the Humans voted Impostor 2 because they think he is the AI. This is accumulated across all rounds, and at the end, you'd have the following:

```
Human 1: +1
Human 2: +2
Human 3: +0
Impostor 1: +1
Impostor 2: +3
AI: +2
```

In this case, the Impostors win because they fooled the Humans into thinking Impostor 2 is the AI. The Humans lose because they didn't figure out who the AI was.

### Q&A

How can the Humans distinguish between the AI and the Impostors?
> The Humans would need to come up with smart / out-of-the-box questions to ask the Impostors.

How can the Impostors fool the Humans?
> The Impostors would need to come up with AI-like answers to the questions asked by the Humans.
